### Question 1 
    1) Implementing DataLoader and Dataset from Scratch for MNIST Dataset
    2) Comparing the Performance of DataLaoder from Scratch and the one provided by Pytorch with batch sizes [128, 256, 512, 1024].

### Question 2: Implementing MLP using Pytorch Module.
    1) Model Architecture : input Neurons = 728 (28*28) Pixels , Hidden Layers = [32,32,32,32] , Output Layers = 10 (num of classes)
    2) Activation function: ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit)
    3) Optimizer  = SGD(Stochastic Gradient Descent)
    4) Loss Function = Cross Entropy Loss

### Question 3: Do Everything From Scratch and Implement BackWard Propagation Also from Scratch.

### Question 4: Do Question 2 and Question 3 Using Activation as Sigmoid and Compare Results with ReLu.
